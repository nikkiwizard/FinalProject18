# Welcome to the Ikea Adventure!

It starts as a lovely day for furniture shopping. Little do you know you may have left your home for the last time...
Fight your way through the department store to escape! Or be stuck there for eternity...

Controls:
  - Spacebar to continue through scenes. (Background will turn completely black when you need to fight)
  - Up Arrow key to fight.
  - Down Arrow key to defend.
  - Right Arrow key to attempt to flee a fight.
  
 During a fight, spam or hold down the keys or else the opponent will continue attacking! I'm sorry that the space bar and the keys are a bit fussy due to FPS but that's ok. You just need to hit them a very specific way.
 
 This is something I made for my Final Project for my programming class. The story line is completely original, written by me. All of the graphics were drawn by me in MS Paint (except for the map pictures). I know it's super ridiculous, but enjoy! :)
